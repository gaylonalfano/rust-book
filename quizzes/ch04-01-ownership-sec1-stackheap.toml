Which of the following best describes the difference between the stack and the heap?

answer.answer = "The stack holds data associated with a specific function, while the heap holds data that can outlive a function"
prompt.distractors = [ 
  "The stack can hold pointers to data stored on the heap, while the heap only holds data without pointers",

context = """
Frames in the stack are associated with a specific function, and are deallocated when the function returns.
Data on the heap can live indefinitely. Note that both stack and heap data can be mutable and can be copyable. The heap is allowed to
contain pointers (even to the stack, as we will see later).

Consider the execution of the following snippet, with the final state shown:

```aquascope,interpreter
#fn main() {
let a = Box::new(15);
let b = a;
let c = Box::new(15);`[]`
#}
```

In the final state, how many copies of the number `15` live anywhere in memory? Write your answer as a digit, such as 0 or 1.
"""
answer.answer = "2"
context = """
The two boxes contain the two copies of the number 15. The assignment `let b = a` copies the heap pointer, but not the number on the heap.
