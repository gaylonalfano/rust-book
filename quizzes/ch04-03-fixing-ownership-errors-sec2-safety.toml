Consider this function that is a simplified variant of the function from the previous quiz:

```
/// Adds "Ph.D." to a person's name
fn award_phd(name: &String) {
    let mut name = *name;
    name.push_str(", Ph.D.");
}
```

The Rust compiler rejects this function with the following error:

```text
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `*name` which is behind a shared reference
 --> test.rs:3:20

3 |     let mut name = *name;

  |                    help: consider borrowing here: `&*name`

Assume that the compiler did NOT reject this function. Select each (if any) of the following programs that could
possibly cause undefined behavior if executed. If none of these programs could cause undefined behavior,

The statement `let mut name = *name` makes `name` take ownership of the input string.

finishes, the string is deallocated. Therefore every program above has undefined behavior, 
because `name` will eventually be deallocated a second time. It does not matter whether `name`
