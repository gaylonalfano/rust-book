Say you have a variable `v` of type `&mut Vec<i32>`, and you want to call the `len` method with the
following signature:

```
impl Vec<i32> {
  fn len(&self) -> usize {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

If you try to compile the expression `v.len()`, which of the following statements best describes what happens?
"""
answer.answer = "It compiles, because the `&mut` reference is implicitly reborrowed as an `&` reference"
prompt.distractors = [
  "It does not compile, because `&mut Vec<i32>` is not the same type as `&Vec<i32>`",
  "It does not compile, `v` is not explicitly dereferenced",
  "It compiles, because `&self` can take any kind of reference"
]
context = """
The expression `v.len()` desugars to `Vec::len(&*v)`, which is a valid re-borrow of `v`, so this expression compiles.
You cannot, however, pass `v` directly to `Vec::len`, since `&self` specifically refers to immutable references.

Consider these two methods that increment a field of a struct. Which style would be more idiomatic for Rust?

struct Point(i32, i32);

  fn incr_v2(&mut self) { self.0 += 1; }

The `incr_v1` method is not idiomatic, because it consumes ownership of the `Point`. This means after calling `p.incr_v1()`, `p` 
would be unusable, which is probably not intended for this method.

Because `get_x` mutably borrows all of `p`, a program cannot use `p` in any way until `x` is no longer used. 
Therefore reading `x` and `p.y` in the same line is an ownership error.
